  abstract = {Using an open-source, Java toolkit of name-matching methods, we experimentally compare string distance metrics on the task of matching entity names. We investigate a number of different metrics proposed by different communities, including edit-distance metrics, fast heuristic string comparators , token-based distance metrics, and hybrid methods. Overall, the best-performing method is a hybrid scheme combining a TFIDF weighting scheme, which is widely used in information retrieval, with the Jaro-Winkler string-distance scheme, which was developed in the probabilistic record linkage community.},

abstract = {Traditional equi-join relies solely on string equality comparisons to perform joins. However, in scenarios such as ad-hoc data analysis in spreadsheets, users increasingly need to join tables whose join-columns are from the same semantic domain but use different textual representations, for which transformations are needed before equi-join can be performed. We develop an Auto-Join system that can automatically search over a rich space of operators to compose a transformation program, whose execution makes input tables equi-join-able. Our evaluation using real test cases collected from both public web tables and proprietary enterprise tables shows that the proposed system can perform the desired transformation joins at interactive speed and with high quality.},
