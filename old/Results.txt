		F-Score | Time

This is a very simple rule based method that compares the first and last word of people with names that share at least one word. It has an F-score of 0.471543859649 and runs in about 2 minutes on my machine on all 183,000 names. It runs in seconds on the 37,000 companies but has an F-score of only about 0.207

Here is another mechanism where we tokenize the words, put them into a set and check if one name is a subset of the other. It has a better success rate for names, with an F-score of 0.582207840022 and a much better one for companies, with an F-Score of 0.508912602583. However, it takes much longer to run running in just under five minutes for all 183,000 names and 20 seconds for the companies.

I have shifted focus too companies rather than names, so I will not be recording name data for now. I also changed the program to pick 3 possibilities and recorded it as a match if any of the names match. 
I noticed that companies often take out or add spaces, and therefore developed a strategy where I remove all spaces in pre-proccesing and check if one name is a substring of another. Here is the data for that method:
possible matches: 25897
total names: 36629
not indexed: 16619
wrongly indexed: 2606.0
all false negitives: 19225.0
true positives: 17400.0
false positives: 2573.0
f-score 0.614862715997999
As you can see, 1/3 of the misses are from missbucketing, it is rare ( <10% of the possible matches) that none of the first three matches match.

Since false positives are low we can combine the previos two methods to get better results, here is the data from that method:
possible matches: 25897
total names: 36629
not indexed: 16033
wrongly indexed: 2597.0
all false negitives: 18630.0
true positives: 17995.0
false positives: 2563.0

I started to pay attention to the significance of words, in that if a bucket contains only one pair, I automatically pair the two items in it. This is the output for combinig this method with the other two:
